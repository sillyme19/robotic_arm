required packages
stable_baselines3,torch,gymnasium,pybullet,numpy and panda_gym
# this is an open ai project which is a robotic arm simulation specifically panda_pick_and_place-V3
install these dependencies and try running the above code for seamless working 
the training period timesteps is keppt as 1500000 for better convergence and optimization
once the training is complete the testing can be done by loading the locally stored weights zip file and the enviromnet(model)
the robotic arm should be working fine
for seamless training cuda can be activated
